### Comments on the provided solution
Copies of items provided in the constructor will be loaded in the tableviews. <br>
This is because the items loaded in the constructor will also be written to a csv, <br> and loaded from said csv.
<br><br>
The items in the tableviews are set again when editing, adding or deleting. <br>
This is done because a filtered list is given to the tableviews when typing in the searchbox. <br>
Filtering the existing list would've been optimal, but the student did not succeed in doing so.
